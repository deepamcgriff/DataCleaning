README

This R script takes unpacked data files described in the CodeBook and applies tidy data principles to rename and aggregate the datasets into one data frame. 

The data is reshaped and keeps only fields including a mean or SD for the measurements captured in the data.

Finally, the code takes the tidy data and produces a summary by subject and activity type of means for each variable.
